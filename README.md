Salutations !
- I am @OluAkilu and currently I am working towards a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
- Things I am most interested in include: Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Front-End Development. I'd like to be a bit of a jack of all trades.
- Right now, I am focusing on Java and Python in preparation for Technical Interviews. I'd love any tips ðŸ˜­ 
- Additionally, some other things I am learning to work with are MongoDB and JavaScript.
- In terms of projects, I'm open to really anything to do with OOP (specifically Java or Python), but particularly game development with or w/o UI \
and other small to mid size projects.
- If you would like to contact me, you can reach my email: ojakibu@gmail.com.
